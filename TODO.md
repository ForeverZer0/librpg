# TODO

## High-Priority

- [ ] Tilemap, single dray call, buffer all data onto GPU
- [ ] Maintain track of current bound texture, only switch when needed (texture handles instead?)

## Normal-Priority

- [ ] Use uniform block for projection matrix?
- [ ] Remove all the redundant "unbindings" of buffers and vertex arrays
- [ ] Remove NULL checks in every API call
- [ ] Use callback driven error reporting instead of return value?
- [ ] Explicit uniform layout, do not store and reference from RPGgame struct

## Before-Release

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Format, code cleanup
- [ ] Double-check naming conventions
